# sqrt-bot (Square Root Bot)
VEX V5 Python Robot

## Namesake:
The side of our robot looks like a square root function, so I named it the Square Root Bot.

## Authors:
**Autonomous Programmer:** Camila Rodriguez &
**Manual Programmer:** Arymus Reyes
I (Arymus Reyes) published this code and have been responsible for all commits to this repo.

## How did it go?
The DWC Robotics Team (dubbed "Clankers" as of writing this), have only played three competitions thus far. But for that statistic, I'd say we didn't do terrible. We placed 19th out of 31, and we got 3 wins and 5 losses. We made it to the quarter finals!

## For next time..
Next time, I'll work on making the code make more sense, and I'll work on autonomous programming so I can help Camila give us autocode that actually scores us points.
